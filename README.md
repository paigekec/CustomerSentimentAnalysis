## NLP Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling on Customer Reviews

## Project Overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews. 
It performs sentiment analysis to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative and uses topic modeling to extract common themes from the feedback. 
The project also includes visualizations to help better understand the sentiment trends and key topics discussed over time.

## Features
- Sentiment Analysis: Classifies each review into positive, negative, or neutral categories using TextBlob.
- Topic Modeling: Identifies common themes in the reviews using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- Data Visualization: Visualizes sentiment distribution and generates a word cloud to highlight frequent terms.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- NLP Libraries: spaCy, TextBlob, nltk
- Topic Modeling: gensim (LDA), scikit-learn (NMF)
- Data Handling: pandas
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloudt

## Dataset
A sample dataset of customer reviews is used in this project. You can replace this dataset with your own collection of customer feedback.

## Key Functions
- Sentiment Analysis: analyze_sentiment(text) – Analyzes the sentiment of the given text and categorizes it as positive, neutral, or negative.
- Topic Modeling: topic_modeling(df) – Identifies the most discussed topics in the reviews using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- Word Cloud Generation: generate_wordcloud(df) – Generates a word cloud to visualize the frequent terms in the reviews.
- Visualization

## The project generates several visualizations:
- Sentiment Distribution: A bar plot showing the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral reviews.
- Word Cloud: A graphical representation of the most frequent words in the reviews.
- Topic Words: A list of the top 10 words for each identified topic.

## Future Improvements
Adding additional NLP techniques, such as named entity recognition (NER) or text summarization.
Enhancing the user interface by deploying the project as a web application using Streamlit or Flask.
Incorporating more advanced machine learning models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
